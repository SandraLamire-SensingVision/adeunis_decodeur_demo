## [1.2.0] - 2019-09-30

In this version all codecs have been updated to best fit one-M2M TS-0023 recommendations.
Therefore this version is not backward compatible with version 1.1.1 regarding output contents (schema, property names,...).
In next versions adeunis will do its best to ensure backward compatibility to limit customer development efforts. 

### Other changes
- User interface has been updated to be more ergonomic
- [JS] Internal core layer has been updated: it is now mandatory to select the product before decoding a frame. Call setDeviceType() method for that purpose.
